# VulnerableExtension
This repository contains the materials for a practical laboratory on exploiting vulnerable Chrome extensions, developed as part of the "Security in Information Systems" course in the fourth year of the "Computer Engineering" university degree.

## Overview
The laboratory explores how insecure practices in Chrome extension development can lead to severe security vulnerabilities. By following the provided steps, students will understand the risks, learn exploitation techniques, and propose mitigation strategies.

## Disclaimer
These extensions are intentionally vulnerable and must not be used outside a controlled laboratory environment. They are for educational purposes only.

## Repository Structure
- `laboratorio.pdf`: A comprehensive guide (in spanish) explaining the objectives, steps, and background for completing the laboratory.
- `extensions/`: Source code of Chrome extensions required for the exercises. Each folder corresponds to a specific extension.

## Getting Started
1. First, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ametsCS/VulnerableExtension.git
```
2. _cd_ into the cloned folder.
3. Review the `laboratorio.pdf` for detailed steps on setting up and exploiting the provided extensions.
4. Follow the guide to load the extensions in Chrome and test the vulnerabilities.

## Extension Installation
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable "Developer Mode" in the top right corner.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder of the desired extension.
